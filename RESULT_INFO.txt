The results I got from the crawl.py script
are saved in tests/csv_files/crawl-results.csv
test_csv_files.py script compares this result with the given crawler-test.com.csv
There are two differences:
- I am one getting additional link 'https://crawler-test.com/relativeurl:withcolon'
- This link changes the path since this is an expiring page 'https://crawler-test.com/other/expiring_page_for_removed_test/1664806911.49134'

To get the closest possible result I used --timeout 3 and only 3 links got the 'Timeout Error' and were not saved:
    100 HTTP Status
    101 HTTP Status
    102 HTTP Status
